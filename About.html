    <p style="color: whitesmoke;">I am <span style="color: white;">Kidshipley</span>, I am an artist who focuses on animation and drawing. I hope to bring Animation as a whole back to it's glory days in the 30's, while also mixing in some early 2000's. I hope that I eventualy make it big, and that you'll be their way before and after I do. </p>
